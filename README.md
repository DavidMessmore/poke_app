# Poke App

This app allows the user to input up to six Pok√©mons and visualize the strengths and weaknesses of the team.

I did this project for learning purposes, and it is inspired by the marriland website.

Here are a few things that i intend to add:

- Allow the user to change the generations (currently it is only gen 9)
- Allow the user to import the chart or the team itself
